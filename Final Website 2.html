  <h2> Bio:</h2>
	<p> My name is Joseph Zimmerman and I was born September 12, 2006 in St. John’s Hospital. I have been swimming ever since I was five years old, and became water safe at the age of eighteen months old. I took a great passion to swimming, which then led me to joining the Los Angeles swim club at the age of eight. It was not until I started club swimming when some of my  upperclassman friends told me about the junior lifeguard program. The second I heard about this program I rushed home after practice and quickly informed my parents to try to sign me up. After doing junior guards ever since I was nine years old, I have taken a great passion into helping and assisting others in need when it comes to pool safety and ocean safety. Ever since I got certified for the Los Angeles fire department I wanted to start a company with some of my junior lifeguard friends to share the importance of ocean, pool, and just in general water safety. I have an amazing team of previous lifeguard cadets and we have been instructing the young minds of today the importance of water safety for over two years. I know that was your reading this paragraph reply thinking to yourself I said water safety way too much, but I cannot stress enough how important it is. When I was about 11 years old my family and I went up to Hawaii for Easter, while my mom and I were boogie boarding and a surfboard hit her in the back of the neck. Thankfully because of my junior lifeguard training I was able to pull her out of the ocean before any other serious damage could’ve been done. She ended up making a full recovery, but I promised myself to make sure peiple can always feel safe when i'm on duty. </p>

  <p2> Lifeguarding has always been a very special part of me ever since I started when I was eight years old. Ever since the first day of junior lifeguards I wanted to help and educate people The importance of knowing what to do while in the ocean or in the pool. I take great pride in making sure children and professional athletes are able to have the safest experience they possibly could have whether it be playing in the pool doing a Swim meet or even just a swim practice. From my personal experiences I have learned a lot of the importance of knowing what to do in times of stress. From my personal experiences I have learned a lot of the importance of knowing what to do in tons of times of stress and anxiety. As a lifeguard I am forced to always be alert. I know how to handle stressful situations. The thing that let me down the path I am going down today was said by a lifeguard named Leigh Simmons, he said to me “ A lifeguard is like a light guiding others to safety.” I took that coat to heart and I was it and I have let it guide me through my journey as a lifeguard. </p2>
