	<center><h1><i><u> Where I Trained </u></i></h1></center>
	<p> I trained at the Junior Lifeguard Program, I traind there ever since I was nine years old. JGs or Junior Gaurds was an amazing way to spend the summer, and the durration of the camp only extends to four weeks. I highly reccomend pleople to try JGs, it keeps you fit and it teaches you about water saftey. The is also the benifit of being on the beach for four hours. If you would like to sign up please read the instructions below.  </p>
